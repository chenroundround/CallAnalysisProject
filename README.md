# CallAnalysisProject

In this project, we analyze the dataset consisting of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services, provided by New York City for public consumption or use.
Our dataset contains roughly 2,587,316 number of cases recorded by 311 non-emergency services within New York City during one year.
It includes a lot of features such as the zip code, area, types of request, status and due date, etc. in order to better study the cases for public use.
